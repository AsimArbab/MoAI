To use the Warehouse Calculator first run warehouseGUI.py.
In the "Warehouse Information" panel press "Load" to choose a warehouse file to import. Then use the "Load order" button to load a text file containing the order. Afterwards press the "Place this order" button to lock it. Now choose a Search algorithm in the "Search Methods" panel, if you want set steps (n) and/or number of states (k) and hit "Go!"
This will give you the number of PSUs moved, their identifiers and inventories.
Depending on the method, configuration, warehouse and hardware the result may take a  few seconds to compute.
You can change the warehouse, order and search methods any time.
